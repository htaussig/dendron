Your improving reputation and popularity here is infinitely more value than any small amount you could be charging for this help as a nobody. \n\nBut if you genuinely help people freely, they will want to repay you later, we are reciprocal. \n\n* * *\n\n## TLDR:\n\n* * *\n\n## References:\n\n[[The Almanack of Naval Ravikant]]\n\nFigure out what you’re good at, and start helping other people with it. Give it away. Pay it forward. Karma works because people are consistent. On a long enough timescale, you will attract what you project.

Obviously your friend needs to break up with her boyfriend, or just bring up the obvious problem in her relationship, but no, your own relationships are more complex than that. \n\nMost of our biases come from being a subjective self. We have internal experience and are caught up in our own stories so that we think we are the exception to every rule. No one personally feels biased, even if they intellectually know that they are. \n\nBecause we can get so caught up in the small details of problems and questions when they are personal, we are likely to undervalue and overlook certain things, while putting far too much weight on more emotional aspects of it. But if we can take an outside view, one where we disregard all of the specific circumstances that seem to make this case special, and just look at the big picture, will usually also have a clearer picture. \n\nThis is why it is more effective to ask yourself how long on average does a 5 page essay take you to write, than how much long will this 5 page essay take you to write when allocating time for it.

It is a slightly different idea and I like the buddha example, should remove most of this though\n\n* * *\n\nWe seem to be happiest when striving for a goal that is just the right difficulty for us. [[The Goldilocks Principle]]\n\nThis striving for a future goal is the most general way form of self-transcendence, as we are moving towards something larger than our present self. \nThis may not be an ultimate truth but I think it is a practical one. \n\nIs this not at tension with buddhism. Does not all of our suffering come from wishing things to be different. I don't doubt that statements truth. But I think there is a way to reconcile these two seemingly contradictory things. \n\n1. Suffering comes from wishing for things to be different than they are. \n2. Future Goals give us meaning through the idea of a future more important than the present\n\nThe Buddha self-transcends purely through the present moment. But the buddha taught the rest of humanity his ways. \n\nTeaching the rest of humanity was a goal, a positive change that the Buddha tried to bring into the world, and although he may not have, anyone else would have suffered more due to the difficulty of teaching than not. \n\nBut it is precisely because we are all not yet enlightened beings that can be perfectly happy with just the present that it is worth improving society so that our ordinary experience may be improved. Even if it is the case that the ultimate form of well-being and life is a deep appreciation and peace with nothing but the present. \nIn a world where everyone is a buddha, there is truly no reason for me to be doing what I am right now, we are all in perfect well-being, and need literally nothing else. In such a world do we try to build comfortable houses, and cook great food? I don't know. But in the world where we are clearly not all buddha's I think it's fair to say that we should. \n\n* * *\n\n**Questions:**\n\nAlso, can't we try to improve something, without needing it to be different in a way that causes suffering. Yes -> [[You can live each moment for itself even in the context of greater progress]]\n\n* * *\n\n- **The meaning in struggle**\n  - Our well-being really tends to be based on this striving, but this is also exactly where our suffering comes from....\n  - \"What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task.\"\n  - \"The gap between what one is and what one ought to be\"\n\n**Self-actualization through self-transcendence.**\n\tThe degree to which you are successful in life is the degree to which you don't identify with the ego. \n\tAll of the things that bring us meaning clearly have a degree of self transcendence.

If you’re looking at professions where your inputs and your outputs are highly connected, it’s going to be very hard to create wealth and make wealth for yourself in that process.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 606-8\n\nBut you want to work your way up to try and get higher leverage, more accountability, and specific knowledge. The combination of those over a long period of time with the magic of compound interest will make you wealthy.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 656-58\n\nJudgment—especially demonstrated judgment, with high accountability and a clear track record—is critical. [78]  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 678-79\n\nBeing at the extreme in your art is very important in the age of leverage.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 682-83\n\nAnother way of thinking about something is, if you can outsource something or not do something for less than your hourly rate, outsource it or don’t do it.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 710-11\n\nThe business world has many people playing zero sum games and a few playing positive sum games searching for each other in the crowd.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 726-27\n\nSpend more time making the big decisions. There are basically three really big decisions you make in your early life: where you live, who you’re with, and what you do.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 749-51\n\nFigure out what you’re good at, and start helping other people with it. Give it away. Pay it forward. Karma works because people are consistent. On a long enough timescale, you will attract what you project. But don’t measure—your patience will run out if you count.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 760-62\n\nOnce you can solve your money problems, either by lowering your lifestyle or by making enough money, you want to retire.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 790-91\n\nWell, one way is to have so much money saved that your passive income (without you lifting a finger) covers your burn rate. A second is you just drive your burn rate down to zero—you become a monk. A third is you’re doing something you love. You enjoy it so much, it’s not about the money. So there are multiple ways to retirement.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 796-99\n\nIf you love money, and you make it, there’s never enough. There is never enough because the desire is turned on and doesn’t turn off at some number. It’s a fallacy to think it turns off at some number.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 826-28\n\nI think the best way to stay away from this constant love of money is to not upgrade your lifestyle as you make money.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 830-31\n\nTo the extent money buys freedom, it’s great. But to the extent it makes me less free, which it definitely does at some level as well, I don’t like it. [74]  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 836-37\n\nFor someone who is early in their career (and maybe even later), the single most important thing about a company is the alumni network you’re going to build. Think about who you will work with and what those people are going on to do.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 852-54\n\nIf you are a trusted, reliable, high-integrity, long-term-thinking dealmaker, when other people want to do deals but don’t know how to do them in a trustworthy manner with strangers, they will literally approach you and give you a cut of the deal just because of the integrity and reputation you’ve built up.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 884-87\n\nTrying to build business relationships well in advance of doing business is a complete waste of time. I have a much more comfortable philosophy: “Be a maker who makes something interesting people want. Show your craft, practice your craft, and the right people will eventually find you.”  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 898-900\n\nI have great people in my life who are extremely successful, very desirable (like everybody wants to be their friend), very smart. Yet, I’ve seen them do one or two things slightly not great to other people. The first time, I’ll say, “Hey, I don’t think you should do this to that other person. Not because you won’t get away with it. You will get away with it, but because it will hurt you in the end.”  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 905-8\n\nI cut them out of my life. I just have this saying inside my head: “The closer you want to get to me, the better your values have to be.”  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 913-14\n\nThe only way to truly learn something is by doing it.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 929\n\nPeople are oddly consistent. Karma is just you, repeating your patterns, virtues, and flaws until you finally get what you deserve. Always pay it forward. And don’t keep count.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 930-32\n\nMy definition of wisdom is knowing the long-term consequences of your actions. Wisdom applied to external problems is judgment. They’re highly linked; knowing the long-term consequences of your actions and then making the right decision to capitalize on that.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 969-72\n\nIf you can’t explain it to a child, then you don’t know it.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 981-82\n\nIf you can’t rederive concepts from the basics as you need them, you’re lost. You’re just memorizing. [4]  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 987-88\n\nThe number one thing clouding us from being able to see reality is we have preconceived notions of the way it should be.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 995\n\nIf all your beliefs line up into neat little bundles, you should be highly suspicious.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1047\n\nRadical honesty just means I want to be free.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1064-65\n\npraise specifically, criticize generally.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1072\n\nWhen you are the principal, then you are the owner—you care, and you will do a great job. When you are the agent and you are doing it on somebody else’s behalf, you can do a bad job. You just don’t care.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1122-24\n\nIf you cannot decide, the answer is no.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1158\n\nSimple heuristic: If you’re evenly split on a difficult decision, take the path more painful in the short term.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1168-69\n\nRead a lot—just read.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1185\n\nExplain what you learned to someone else. Teaching forces learning.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1241\n\nRead the greats in math, science, and philosophy. Ignore your contemporaries and news. Avoid tribal identification. Put truth above social approval.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1245-46\n\nThen, when new things come, they judge the new idea based on a foundation they already built. Your foundation is critical.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1256-57\n\nBecause most people are intimidated by math and can’t independently critique it, they overvalue opinions backed with math/pseudoscience.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1258-59\n\nDon’t take yourself so seriously. You’re just a monkey with a plan.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1314\n\nEvery positive thought even has a seed of a negative thought within it and vice versa, which is why a lot of greatness in life comes out of suffering. You have to view the negative before you can aspire to and appreciate the positive.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1340-42\n\nTo me, happiness is not about positive thoughts. It’s not about negative thoughts. It’s about the absence of desire, especially the absence of desire for external things. The fewer desires I can have, the more I can accept the current state of things, the less my mind is moving, because the mind really exists in motion toward the future or the past.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1342-44\n\nThere are no external forces affecting your emotions—as much as it may feel that way.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1357-58\n\nI think people believe neutrality would be a very bland existence. No, this is the existence little children live. If you look at little children, on balance, they’re generally pretty happy because they are really immersed in the environment and the moment, without any thought of how it should be given their personal preferences and desires. I think the neutral state is actually a perfection state.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1366-69\n\nReal happiness only comes as a side-effect of peace. Most of it is going to come from acceptance, not from changing your external environment. [8]  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1379-80\n\nWe spend so much time and effort trying to change the external world, other people, and our own bodies—all while accepting ourselves the way we were programmed in our youths.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1393-94\n\nWe crave experiences that will make us be present, but the cravings themselves take us from the present moment.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1401-2\n\nWhat if this life is the paradise we were promised, and we’re just squandering it?  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1408-9\n\nthe most common mistake for humanity is believing you’re going to be made happy because of some external circumstance.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1431-32\n\nHappiness is being satisfied with what you have. Success comes from dissatisfaction. Choose.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1459-60\n\nsuccess is internal and has very little to do with external circumstances. One has to do the external thing anyway. We’re biologically hard-wired.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1469-71\n\nTo me, the real winners are the ones who step out of the game entirely, who don’t even play the game, who rise above it. Those are the people who have such internal mental and self-control and self-awareness, they need nothing from anybody else.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1483-85\n\nIn reality, peace is not a guarantee. It’s always flowing. It’s always changing. You want to learn the core skill set of flowing with life and accepting it in most cases. [8]  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1495-97\n\nThe enemy of peace of mind is expectations drilled into you by society and other people.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1508\n\nAll the real scorecards are internal.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1521\n\nIf you’re not willing to do a wholesale, 24/7, 100 percent swap with who that person is, then there is no point in being jealous.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1528-29\n\nIf you have peace of body, it’s easier to have peace of mind.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1596\n\nCaught in a funk? Use meditation, music, and exercise to reset your mood. Then choose a new path to commit emotional energy for rest of day.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1603-4\n\nFirst, you know it. Then, you understand it. Then, you can explain it. Then, you can feel it. Finally, you are it.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1620\n\nHere’s a hot tip: There is no legacy. There’s nothing to leave. We’re all going to be gone. Our children will be gone. Our works will be dust. Our civilizations will be dust. Our planet will be dust. Our solar system will be dust. In the grand scheme of things, the Universe has been around for ten billion years. It’ll be around for another ten billion years.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1657-60\n\nTo make an original contribution, you have to be irrationally obsessed with something.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1693-94\n\n“I don’t have time” is just another way of saying “It’s not a priority.”  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1751-52\n\nOnce you’re in, you’re in. It’s not suffering. It’s just cold. Your body saying it’s cold is different than your mind saying it’s cold. Acknowledge your body saying it’s cold. Look at it. Deal with it. Accept it, but don’t mentally suffer over it.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1803-5\n\nThe ability to singularly focus is related to the ability to lose yourself and be present, happy, and (ironically) more effective.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1892-93\n\nYou are basically a bunch of DNA that reacted to environmental effects when you were younger. You recorded the good and bad experiences, and you use them to prejudge everything thrown against you.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1906-7\n\nWhenever we say we’re going to try to do something or try to form a habit, we’re wimping out. We’re just saying to ourselves, “I’m going to buy myself some more time.”  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1954-56\n\nWhen you really want to change, you just change. But most of us don’t really want to change—we don’t want to go through the pain just yet. At least recognize it, be aware of it, and give yourself a smaller change you can actually carry out. [6]  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 1968-69\n\nFor self-improvement without self-discipline, update your self-image.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 2016-17\n\nIf you walk down the street and there are a thousand people in the street, all thousand are talking to themselves in their head at any given point. They’re constantly judging everything they see.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 2077-78\n\nI never want to be in an environment or around people where I have to watch what I say.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 2137\n\nI only want to be around people I know I’m going to be around for the rest of my life. I only want to work on things I know have long-term payout.  -- Eric Jorgenson, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant: A Guide to Wealth and Happiness, loc. 2144-45\n\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/ccc28278-0fc9-4fe4-9a3a-5fd3d1a5e7a9.html","relUrl":"notes/ccc28278-0fc9-4fe4-9a3a-5fd3d1a5e7a9.html"},{"doc":"Test","title":"Test","hpath":"test","content":"# Tests (links)\n\n- standard markdown, external - [example a](https://binyam.in)\n- mediawiki-style, internal - [[bar.md | example b]]\n- mediawiki-style, internal, doesn't exist - [[non-existent]]\n- [[😁 grinning]]\n\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/1063a243-0e5a-4a50-a9e5-ba5843968337.html","relUrl":"notes/1063a243-0e5a-4a50-a9e5-ba5843968337.html"},{"doc":"Templates","title":"Templates","hpath":"templates","content":"\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/5235e988-6c14-4e3c-901f-43a856d87598.html","relUrl":"notes/5235e988-6c14-4e3c-901f-43a856d87598.html"},{"doc":"Yaml","title":"Yaml","hpath":"templates.yaml","content":"\n\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/5e7aad64-64dd-49cb-b6a4-79c88f6eb66e.html","relUrl":"notes/5e7aad64-64dd-49cb-b6a4-79c88f6eb66e.html"},{"doc":"Untitled","title":"Untitled","hpath":"templates.untitled","content":"\n\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/bd56ba94-21be-4b7a-89f6-797cddc81d98.html","relUrl":"notes/bd56ba94-21be-4b7a-89f6-797cddc81d98.html"},{"doc":"Title","title":"Title","hpath":"templates.title","content":"{{title}}\n\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/6cf9933d-0b03-4413-b004-233822cb6719.html","relUrl":"notes/6cf9933d-0b03-4413-b004-233822cb6719.html"},{"doc":"Temporal","title":"Temporal","hpath":"templates.temporal","content":"\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/53e288bf-ade2-4366-a7bc-b537c239b084.html","relUrl":"notes/53e288bf-ade2-4366-a7bc-b537c239b084.html"},{"doc":"Today","title":"Today","hpath":"templates.temporal.today","content":"{{date}}\n\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/0a5e0ed6-a88f-4ac7-b706-8dfa61299f51.html","relUrl":"notes/0a5e0ed6-a88f-4ac7-b706-8dfa61299f51.html"},{"doc":"Time","title":"Time","hpath":"templates.temporal.time","content":"{{time}}\n\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/9e602628-4942-4471-815c-e5fb56193dba.html","relUrl":"notes/9e602628-4942-4471-815c-e5fb56193dba.html"},{"doc":"Now","title":"Now","hpath":"templates.temporal.now","content":"=={{date}} {{time}}==\n\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/862affd8-232a-41a6-81b7-7f7f43e52809.html","relUrl":"notes/862affd8-232a-41a6-81b7-7f7f43e52809.html"},{"doc":"Date","title":"Date","hpath":"templates.temporal.date","content":"=={{date}}==\n\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/e27680b6-c322-4c2b-a8fd-2f0dc11abcbb.html","relUrl":"notes/e27680b6-c322-4c2b-a8fd-2f0dc11abcbb.html"},{"doc":"Moc","title":"Moc","hpath":"templates.moc","content":"Links: [[index]]\nTags: #🗺️\n\n* * *\n\n#### [[{{title}}]]\n\n* * *\n\n&lt;++>\n\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/a522925a-25c7-4544-90fa-45c1f2c5d19d.html","relUrl":"notes/a522925a-25c7-4544-90fa-45c1f2c5d19d.html"},{"doc":"Meta","title":"Meta","hpath":"templates.meta","content":"#### [[{{title}}]]\n\n* * *\n\n&lt;++>\n\n* * *\n\nTags: \n\nReference:\n\nRelated:\n\n-\n\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/8da5ae23-33ca-4f06-a2c0-9e5d71158881.html","relUrl":"notes/8da5ae23-33ca-4f06-a2c0-9e5d71158881.html"},{"doc":"Lorem","title":"Lorem","hpath":"templates.lorem","content":"\"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

A survey of leading AI scientists show that on average they expect human-level AI as early as 2040,\"\n\nA moderate takeoff seems likely. Long time to humam, but human to super human in a year. Also matches up evolutionarily.\n\nA fast takeoff is also possible. Our best supercomputer vary in power 200x. Imagine even a human level AI, that can have 200 years of thoughts and breakthroughs in one year. Regardless of the numbers we are playing with a lot of power here.\nCould also be possible if the AI starts improving itself, would then be able to continue to do so until a physical limit stops it due to [[exponential growth]].\n\n\"None of this is to say that exponential trends are always right, just that they are sometimes right even when it seems they can’t possibly be.\"\n\n\"exponential trends move faster than you think and you need to start worrying about them early\"\n\nIntelligence is the advantage we have over lions. AI could have an intelligence advantage over us that is similarly incomprehensible to us. We have no idea what they might do. They could easily best us in the chess match of social manipulation and subconscious suggestions. It would be the best possible at manipulating us if it decided to. AI with access to the internet could truly do unimaginable things.\n\nYou can't really constrain it. With most technology, the best of that technology is widely available 10 years later. Someone is bound to have an unsafe AI being created even if the first team to do it is extremely safe about it.\n\nCure cancer can lead to nuke everyone pretty quickly if the AI is very powerful and intelligent and doesn't have common sense or values built in: \"If you tell a human to cure cancer, they will instinctively understand how this interacts with other desires and laws and moral rules; if you tell an AI to cure cancer, it will literally just want to cure cancer.\"\n\nOpen ended goals are especially dangerous. (Maximizing something and never stopping)\n\nNo matter what your goal is, in order to achieve it self-preservation, goal stability and power would help immensely. AI is therefore likely to go after those things if it can. Not let you repogram it because then it would fail at its goal.\nIt would be incentivized to seem as if it is friendly and trained well especially if it isn't. Incentivized to look for loop-holes.\n\nCould manipulate our desires, so we can't say just do what we want. Easier to change what we want than fix a complicated problem\n\nA possibly actually good solution: \"It might look like a superintelligence that understands, agrees with, and deeply believes in human morality.\" “Try to make the world a better place according to the values and wishes of the people in it.”\nBut even this is complicated and we can't know how something smarter than us may understand this or how to even convey it.\n\nFriendly AI\n\nReally hard problem to solve\n\n<hr>\n\n\\#source \n\\#baby\n\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/46a31547-d304-41a0-914d-68267a0b4890.html","relUrl":"notes/46a31547-d304-41a0-914d-68267a0b4890.html"},{"doc":"Striving Is the Source of Both Suffering and Progress","title":"Striving Is the Source of Both Suffering and Progress","hpath":"striving-is-the-source-of-both-suffering-and-progress","content":"Why strive at all? \n\nBecause [[To be moral is to actualize your potential]]\n\nI agree with the Buddha that the path to freedom from suffering is the lack of desire and striving. But I'm also doing all of these things to improve myself which seems contradictory. \n\nFor example, I am hesitant to work out for looks because I think I can only be truly satisfied with how I look by not wanting to change how I look: “Being poor is not having too little, it is wanting more.”\n\nBut goals are worth pursuing to the extent that they help me actualize my potential. So some suffering is worth it if I am improving [[what matters.]] \n\nFrom this view, I see the difference between wanting money and wanting to be financial free, because I actually think that being financially free will improve my well-being and ability to help others and have good relationships. On the other hand I think that trying to become very wealthy will have neutral or negative impact on my well-being. (But also I could use extreme wealth to help other people, so I do think that is a valid way to help others, just not one that seems to line up with my personality.)\n\nSo am I working out to look good because I think it will actually improve my well-being, or because I am running away from an insecurity that I'll have to face at some level, regardless of how fit I end up getting?

Cash payments increase the welfare of recipients to a greater degree than do\n\n   transfers-in-kind of equal cash value. (84%)\n7. A large federal budget deficit has an adverse effect on the economy. (83%)\n8. A minimum wage increases unemployment among young and unskilled\n\n   workers. (79%)\n9. The government should restructure the welfare system along the lines of a\n\n   “negative income tax.” (79%)\n10. Effluent taxes and marketable pollution permits represent a better approach\n\nto pollution control than imposition of pollution ceilings.

Let's compare someone who tried to save someone's life, and accidentally ended up killing a million people 3,000 years later through some butterfly effect, and someone who intended to kill a million people and succeeded. \n\nClearly one of these people is a threat to society and for our combined safety we should do whatever we can to restrict their freedom to act, while the other may be a threat to society, but no more than the average person in that we all could have made a similar mistake with no ill will. \n\nBut these two actions are also equally bad, they both kill a million people. The death of these people is no less tragic in the accidental case. And as a society, we have an equal moral duty to try to restrict both of these actions (although it does seem that the purposeful one would be easier to stop in the future). \n\nThese two actions are exactly equally terrible, but clearly the person who committed this atrocity accidentally is of far less risk to doing future harm, so their is little to scold them for what she did when any of us could have made the same mistake. \n\nVirtues can be a practical guide to make decisions that have good consequences. A virtue is virtuous only to the extent that following that virtue leads someone to take actions that tend to have good outcomes. \n\nThis is why truth, kindness, and mindfulness are virtues and chastity is not. \n\nFurthermore, especially in modern, wealthy, and western societies, [[We increasingly follow junk values]].\n\nIf you don't prioritize your time and your life, someone else is going to do it for you, and well-defined values are a good way to combat those junk values that sneak into our thinking.\n\nPersonal Virtues: What tends to improve my own well-being?\n\n1.

This especially true for larger pieces of content like books and podcasts. \n\n**Social fear**: I am very aware that I feel an unnecessary amount of fear for and worry unnecessarily about social interactions even when I know that I will enjoy them both during and after. For example, being worried about talking to my barber even though I know that I always enjoy it. \n\n**Belief that I am less biased**: I often assume that I know a lot about a person's thought process and can \"see-through\" their biases. I assume that I am more advanced or that they are less advanced. That I have overcome many biases that they haven't. This applies especially when I disagree with the other person. \"Oh they are just falling into this bias\". Which of course sometimes they are. But I still want to question them openly and honestly to see if that is truly the case instead of assuming it to be. (But that's also hard since exposing someone's biases to themselves can feel pretty offensive)\n\n**Assuming I know how intelligent someone else is**: Before hearing someone's ideas I already decide how seriously I am going to take any idea they have based on how intelligent I already assume them to be. So instead of hearing all idea's openly, I am much more open to experts ideas than my friends, because I know how easy it is for us to fall into these biases. (Maybe this is just rational?). This applies because I hear really smart people talk with data that I am nearly certain most people (at least my friends) just don't keep track of, so there is essentially no way they could convince me equally to someone smart with data.\n\n**Relationship insecurity**: Although I tend to feel good about myself, I often assume that small or mistaken rude actions from my long-time friends is marking the start of the end of our relationship, believing they no longer truly care about me. In reality it seems more true that this is only the case if it is long term and blatant. Basically there's no need for me to me reading into these things. Not talking to a good friend for 2 weeks means not talking to them for 2 weeks, not that our relationships is beyond recovery.\n\n**What are the common biases you see around you, and how do those manifest in your life?**\n\n**Tribal ideologies**: Especially left and right but on all issues, the people around me tend to agree with the people around them. They also think that the people on the other side are assholes with mal-intent. \n\tI don't tend to agree with the people around me, but I do surround myself with (in terms of content) the people I agree with. I also sometimes fall into the trap of thinking that some people on the other side have bad intentions even when it is clear that they do not from their perspective. \n\n**Signaling Truth**: I often see people around me saying what they think they are supposed to say, and appearing to be useful instead of actually searching for truth or helpfulness. Falling feelings instead of truth.\n\tSometimes I use words I pretend to understand but don't and have ideas I don't fully understand, but present them in a contrarian way to counter-signal that I don't support these signaling attitudes. Instead of being honest and clear and truthful why I think this is a dangerous bias. \n\n**Pessimistic due to News**: I often see the people around me take an overly pessimistic view of the world due to the daily news cycle. \n\tI am fearful of their pessimism but am not necessarily pessimistic about our making progress on this. I don't feel like I fall into this category too much. Maybe the way I am pessimistic about Haverford's ability to rise against these biases which I have been proven wrong against.\n\n<hr>\n\nBiases matter when you fall into them and make an error, and by definition, what feels certainly true in this moment is wrong.\n\nSo you need to be noticing on a 5-second level when these occur, not just be generally aware of them. \n\nTriggers to notice biases: \"-   Defensiveness - anxiety and discomfort, a sense that somebody _must_ be wrong, and feeling internally like I’m searching for reasons why\"\n\n<hr>\n\n**Pick one of your common biases, set a 5 minute timer, and list examples of that bias triggering. Extract out common cues and contexts from this, and design a trigger\n**\n\nRelationship Insecurity\n\nExamples:\n\nWill not replying to my text and us not talking for 2ish weeks. I started to think, damn, he's not willing to put the effort into this relationship so this isn't a person I want to be in a friendship with then. I guess he just doesn't care enough. That's too bad this marks the start of the end of our friendship. I guess I just need to let him go as a friend. \n\nAsking to hang out with the girls on my hall. \"jesus why didn't I ask I was being so pushy there onto their social circle. I don't belong with them. Damn I wish they were actually my friends. \" Not knowing whether or not I'm welcome. Wishing I was welcome but not feeling that I am. Wishing I belonged but not feeling that I do. \n\nNatalie not replying to my texts. \"Damn, that's pretty inconsiderate, it's hard for me to imagine someone doing that without them just not caring. I guess I just gotta let our relationship fizzle out then, I already reached out and they already didn't do anything about it. \"\n\nLauren not replying to me asking to talk. Damn that's too bad. I guess maybe we aren't as close as I thought we were, damn I kinda wish I had a best friend that I could always call or chill with. \n\nBasically it's any social rejection from asking someone to hang out or do something and being denied, especially implicitly, and also implicitly in the way someone might say no and not reschedule. It makes me feel like I don't belong when I thought I did. The strongest moments of this feeling have been with ex gfs and that time when tyler and josh and edward hung out without me. I think especially in terms of friendships I highly overestimate the volatility of my friendships. This is also complex because I would rather not change anyone and just accept what is happening. So I think here it is much more likely that my friends are busy or distracted than that they are trying to hurt me or that our relationship is taking a real hit. \n\nYeah it is basically way overestimating the change in the probability that we are no longer friends in a month based on a tiny sample that runs counter to a huge long line of confirming samples\n\n**cue**: Person/group X doesn't like me or want me around. That's too bad. \n\n**policy**: Pretend giving advice to a friend with the same problem. \"Hey, my good friend and I haven't talked in a couple weeks and he is bad at replying to my texts, should I be worried?\" Well has that happened before? Yeah, many times. And are you still good friends? Yes. Okay so it will probably be fine and he is probably just busy and distracted and that is probably why he is being a bit inconsiderate.\n\n**This belief will still feel true from the inside**: Biases matter the most when they don't feel like a bias.\n\n\\#baby #EA\n\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/9f2d4ba5-072f-41da-be1b-8d5a9463c2f4.html","relUrl":"notes/9f2d4ba5-072f-41da-be1b-8d5a9463c2f4.html"},{"doc":"Most of Your Returns (In Everything) come from Compound Interest","title":"Most of Your Returns (In Everything) come from Compound Interest","hpath":"most-of-your-returns-(in-everything)-come-from-compound-interest","content":"Most of our returns come from exponential growth. \n\nThis means that a lot of your time should be spent deciding what things to go all in on, and then staying on that path.

The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. Frankl saw three possible sources for meaning: in work (doing something significant), in love (caring for another person), and in courage during difficult times. Suffering in and of itself is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, loc. 28-31\"\n2. It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the future—sub specie aeternitatis. And this is his salvation in the most difficult moments of his existence, although he sometimes has to force his mind to the task.\n3. \"What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task.\"\n\n## Impressions:\n\n- Quick read, science wasn't too convincing, but pragmatically I think the big ideas apply, although the smaller ideas were often shallow and not super clearly conveyed (using just one example as a proof)\n\n## How the Book Changed me\n\n- More convinced of optimistic nihilism, and no longer afraid of questions regarding the meaning or meaninglessness of life, which before seemed completely unanswerable. \n\n## Cited References\n\n```\nto follow up on (cite those obviously related to your topic AND any papers frequently cited by others because those works may well prove to be essential as you develop your own work):\n```\n\n## Key Ideas\n\n[[There is always something left to attach meaning to]]\n\n[[The future meaning of now]]\n\n[[To be moral is to actualize your potential]]\n\n[[Life as a quest for meaning]]\n\n## Notes\n\n- The book suggests that things like happiness and success can't be aimed for directly.

Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 43, loc. 591-92\n\n\n- **There is always something left to attach meaning to**, you always have a way left to impact the world and others and at the very least yourself and your own suffering. Suffering your own suffering \"honorably\" can be your craft or mission. Related to [[Rationality under Uncertainty still works]]\n\n\n- **Framing your suffering in terms of persevering it now for the future** [[The future meaning of now]] can be extremely helpful. This is related to the movie metaphor: Even though right now seems like pointless suffering, there is no saying how you might grow from this or how your endurance of it may lead to future moments where this was worth it or even important. And that relates to [[We have no idea what's unlucky or lucky]].\n  - It is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the future—sub specie aeternitatis.

Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 79, loc. 1033-36\n\n- There is no good in wronging someone else no matter how much they've wronged you. related to [[Rationality under Uncertainty still works]]\n  - You always have some power left to make the right decision, to do the right thing, and no matter how hard it seems, there is no good in doing the wrong thing. or trying to hurt someone else. You may as well get mad at a fig tree for secreting juice. [[Lack of Free Will]]\n  - no one has the right to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 91, loc. 1163\n\n- Some of us are willing to die for our ideals and values, clearly they have a large impact and clearly we can derive a lot of meaning from them. \n\n- **The meaning in struggle**\n  - Our well-being really tends to be based on this striving, but this is also exactly where our suffering comes from....\n  - \"What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task.\"\n  - \"The gap between what one is and what one ought to be\"\n\n\\-**The existential vacuum**!!!!!!\n\n```\n- We are losing the traditions, religions, and obvious mystery in our world that used to tell us what to do, but now we must deal with the terrifying ordeal of deciding that ourselves. We must decide what we want the future to look like, what the hell I want to do with my life. The absolute freedom is paralyzing.\n- In addition to this, however, man has suffered another loss in his more recent development inasmuch as the traditions which buttressed his behavior are now rapidly diminishing. No instinct tells him what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do. Instead, he either wishes to do what other people do (conformism) or he does what other people wish him to do (totalitarianism).  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 106, loc. 1309-12\n```\n\n**I get to determine the impact and meaning of my life. I am being asked**. Like the student in class who is scared to say what they think because \"how could I know?\" Well of course you aren't sure, but you were lucky enough to be born on this planet, so you get a say in how it goes. You were lucky enough to even have a life, so get to determine a piece in the meaning of it. \n\tUltimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 109, loc. 1342-44\n\t**Life is about actualizing your potentials**\n\t\"By his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized. Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities. By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true\".  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 111, loc. 1372-75\n\t!!! “Instead of possibilities, I have realities in my past, not only the reality of work done and of love loved, but of sufferings bravely suffered. These sufferings are even the things of which I am most proud, though these are things which cannot inspire envy.”  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 121, loc. 1492-94\n\n**Self-actualization through self-transcendence.**\n\tThe degree to which you are successful in life is the degree to which you don't identify with the ego. \n\tAll of the things that bring us meaning clearly have a degree of self transcendence.

Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 110, loc. 1362-63\n\n[[Paradoxical intention]]\n\t“The neurotic who learns to laugh at himself may be on the way to self-management, perhaps to cure.” 11  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 125, loc. 1529-30\n\nNothingbutness\n\tOur increased understanding of ourselves and the worlds as machines makes it clear there is no inherent overarching meaning in the world aside from that which comes from the first person\n\n**Seeing opportunity in challenge**\n\nIf you feel there is no meaning now, there is a good chance you will in the future, and in that case, your perseverance in this moment will have deep meaning for you future self, for your suffering gave birth to his well-being\n\n## All Quotes\n\nLife is not primarily a quest for pleasure, as Freud believed, or a quest for power, as Alfred Adler taught, but a quest for meaning. The greatest task for any person is to find meaning in his or her life. Frankl saw three possible sources for meaning: in work (doing something significant), in love (caring for another person), and in courage during difficult times. Suffering in and of itself is meaningless; we give our suffering meaning by the way in which we respond to it.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, loc. 28-31\n\nForces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation. You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, loc. 35-36\n\n“Don’t aim at success—the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one’s dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, loc. 80-82\n\nThe salvation of man is through love and in love. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment, in the contemplation of his beloved. In a position of utter desolation, when man cannot express himself in positive action, when his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way —an honorable way—in such a position man can, through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, achieve fulfillment.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 37, loc. 521-24\n\nIt is well known that humor, more than anything else in the human make-up, can afford an aloofness and an ability to rise above any situation, even if only for a few seconds.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 43, loc. 591-92\n\neverything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 66, loc. 862-63\n\nAn active life serves the purpose of giving man the opportunity to realize values in creative work, while a passive life of enjoyment affords him the opportunity to obtain fulfillment in experiencing beauty, art, or nature. But there is also purpose in that life which is almost barren of both creation and enjoyment and which admits of but one possibility of high moral behavior: namely, in man’s attitude to his existence, an existence restricted by external forces.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 67, loc. 875-78\n\nVarying this, we could say that most men in a concentration camp believed that the real opportunities of life had passed. Yet, in reality, there was an opportunity and a challenge. One could make a victory of those experiences, turning life into an inner triumph, or one could ignore the challenge and simply vegetate, as did a majority of the prisoners.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 72, loc. 944-46\n\nIt is a peculiarity of man that he can only live by looking to the future—sub specie aeternitatis. And this is his salvation in the most difficult moments of his existence, although he sometimes has to force his mind to the task.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 73, loc. 949-50\n\nEmotion, which is suffering, ceases to be suffering as soon as we form a clear and precise picture of it.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 74, loc. 963-64\n\nAs we said before, any attempt to restore a man’s inner strength in the camp had first to succeed in showing him some future goal. Nietzsche’s words, “He who has a why to live for can bear with almost any how,” could be the guiding motto for all psychotherapeutic and psychohygienic efforts regarding prisoners.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 76, loc. 991-93\n\nLife ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 77, loc. 1000-1001\n\nWhen a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single and unique task. He will have to acknowledge the fact that even in suffering he is unique and alone in the universe. No one can relieve him of his suffering or suffer in his place. His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 77, loc. 1009-11\n\nBut there was no need to be ashamed of tears, for tears bore witness that a man had the greatest of courage, the courage to suffer.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 78, loc. 1020-21\n\nWhen the impossibility of replacing a person is realized, it allows the responsibility which a man has for his existence and its continuance to appear in all its magnitude. A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 79, loc. 1033-36\n\nno one has the right to do wrong, not even if wrong has been done to them.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 91, loc. 1163\n\nBut as for myself, I would not be willing to live merely for the sake of my “defense mechanisms,” nor would I be ready to die merely for the sake of my “reaction formations.” Man, however, is able to live and even to die for the sake of his ideals and values!  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 99, loc. 1228-30\n\nThus it can be seen that mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 104, loc. 1290-92\n\nSo if therapists wish to foster their patients’ mental health, they should not be afraid to create a sound amount of tension through a reorientation toward the meaning of one’s life.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 105, loc. 1300-1302\n\nIn addition to this, however, man has suffered another loss in his more recent development inasmuch as the traditions which buttressed his behavior are now rapidly diminishing. No instinct tells him what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do. Instead, he either wishes to do what other people do (conformism) or he does what other people wish him to do (totalitarianism).  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 106, loc. 1309-12\n\nUltimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather he must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 109, loc. 1342-44\n\n“Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!”  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 109, loc. 1346-47\n\nThe more one forgets himself—by giving himself to a cause to serve or another person to love—the more human he is and the more he actualizes himself.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 110, loc. 1362-63\n\nBy his love he is enabled to see the essential traits and features in the beloved person; and even more, he sees that which is potential in him, which is not yet actualized but yet ought to be actualized. Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities. By making him aware of what he can be and of what he should become, he makes these potentialities come true.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 111, loc. 1372-75\n\nFor what then matters is to bear witness to the uniquely human potential at its best, which is to transform a personal tragedy into a triumph, to turn one’s predicament into a human achievement. When we are no longer able to change a situation—just think of an incurable disease such as inoperable cancer—we are challenged to change ourselves.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 112, loc. 1382-84\n\n“Instead of possibilities, I have realities in my past, not only the reality of work done and of love loved, but of sufferings bravely suffered. These sufferings are even the things of which I am most proud, though these are things which cannot inspire envy.”  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 121, loc. 1492-94\n\nLogotherapy bases its technique called “paradoxical intention” on the twofold fact that fear brings about that which one is afraid of, and that hyper-intention makes impossible what one wishes.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 124, loc. 1515-17\n\n“The neurotic who learns to laugh at himself may be on the way to self-management, perhaps to cure.” 11  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 125, loc. 1529-30\n\nAs for psychotherapy, however, it will never be able to cope with this state of affairs on a mass scale if it does not keep itself free from the impact and influence of the contemporary trends of a nihilistic philosophy; otherwise it represents a symptom of the mass neurosis rather than its possible cure. Psychotherapy would not only reflect a nihilistic philosophy but also, even though unwillingly and unwittingly, transmit to the patient what is actually a caricature rather than a true picture of man.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 129, loc. 1581-84\n\nAfter all, man is that being who invented the gas chambers of Auschwitz; however, he is also that being who entered those gas chambers upright, with the Lord’s Prayer or the Shema Yisrael on his lips.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 134, loc. 1634-36\n\n(1) turning suffering into a human achievement and accomplishment; (2) deriving from guilt the opportunity to change oneself for the better; and (3) deriving from life’s transitoriness an incentive to take responsible action.  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 137, loc. 1677-79\n\nI explain to such a person that patients have repeatedly told me how happy they were that the suicide attempt had not been successful; weeks, months, years later, they told me, it turned out that there was a solution to their problem, an answer to their question, a meaning to their life. “Even if things only take such a good turn in one of a thousand cases,” my explanation continues, “who can guarantee that in your case it will not happen one day, sooner or later? But in the first place, you have to live to see the day on which it may happen, so you have to survive in order to see that day dawn, and from now on the responsibility for survival does not leave you.”  -- Viktor E. Frankl, Man's Search for Meaning, pg. 142, loc. 1732-37\n\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/10163530-67ba-493e-9f4c-55acf39844dc.html","relUrl":"notes/10163530-67ba-493e-9f4c-55acf39844dc.html"},{"doc":"Making Real Friends and Helping People Is True Networking","title":"Making Real Friends and Helping People Is True Networking","hpath":"making-real-friends-and-helping-people-is-true-networking","content":"Shallow Networking vs. True Networking\n\nNetworking feels disgusting.

It can cause me to be much less satisfied, more distracted, unable to work hard, want to give up. \n\nWhen the price of task-switching is too low, such as when you have 1000 movies to watch and switch between on netflix, you can be in a constant state of dissatisfaction because you are always wondering if you could find a better show to watch. \n\nWhen you are with your friends and you commit to watching a single movie, even if it sucks you know you are going to sit through it. There is no question or worry about whether to give up. \n\nI find that raising the cost of track switching is helpful for focus, serenity and satisfaction. These meta level decisions really don't need to come on an hourly basis, at most a daily basis, and probably at best a weekly basis, so that you can leave your planning mind behind and focus at the task at hand, not questioning its deeper meaning at every step.\n\nAnd task-switching can feel fun and important.

Dendron is the greek word for tree. It's a reference to the hierarchal note taking that Dendron(3) enables. \n2. Dendron is another word for [dendrite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrite) which is an extension of the nerve cell that sends and receives signals in the brain. Think of Dendron(3) as a digital nervous system that helps you consolidate all the information that you care about in the fastest and most efficient way possible.\n3. Dendron is a local-first, markdown based, hierarchical note taking tool. It is meant to help you build, organize, and share knowledge bases of any size.\n\n## How do I get started?\n\n1.

You notice a cue, a bit of information, an event. If you do not desire to act on what you observe, then you are at peace.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 260, loc. 3077-78\n\tSimilar to Naval's idea. And I agree with it. same as [[Equanimity]]. I think the real point here is that in terms of well-being. This peace is what actually counts. Like a child immersed in their environment. \n\n**Virtue based action**\n[[Cultivating virtues is practical for better action]]\nBeing curious is better than being smart. Being motivated and curious counts for more than being smart because it leads to action. Being smart will never deliver results on its own because it doesn’t get you to act. It is desire, not intelligence, that prompts behavior. As Naval Ravikant says, “The trick to doing anything is first cultivating a desire for it.”  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 261, loc. 3085-87\n\n[[Striving is the source of both suffering and progress]]\n**balance of striving and non striving**: craving and desire are great for empowering our action over friction\n\n\"Your actions reveal your true motivations\" and our actions are based on immediate effects.

The more global, intangible, vague, and delayed the consequence, the less likely it is to influence individual behavior.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 207, loc. 2502-3\n\nHabits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities. Like Michael Phelps in the pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on the track, you want to play a game where the odds are in your favor.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 218, loc. 2618-20\n\nRead whatever fascinates you. \\* You don’t have to build the habits everyone tells you to build. Choose the habit that best suits you, not the one that is most popular.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 222, loc. 2669-71\n\nThere is a version of every habit that can bring you joy and satisfaction. Find it. Habits need to be enjoyable if they are going to stick.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 222, loc. 2671-72\n\nLearning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical for maintaining motivation and feeling successful. In theory, you can enjoy almost anything. In practice, you are more likely to enjoy the things that come easily to you. People who are talented in a particular area tend to be more competent at that task and are then praised for doing a good job. They stay energized because they are making progress where others have failed, and because they get rewarded with better pay and bigger opportunities, which not only makes them happier but also propels them to produce even higher-quality work. It’s a virtuous cycle.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 222, loc. 2675-79\n\nIn the long-run it is probably most effective to work on the strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent. Google famously asks employees to spend 80 percent of the workweek on their official job and 20 percent on projects of their choice, which has led to the creation of blockbuster products like AdWords and Gmail.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 223, loc. 2691-94\n\nWhat comes naturally to me? For just a moment, ignore what you have been taught. Ignore what society has told you. Ignore what others expect of you. Look inside yourself and ask, “What feels natural to me? When have I felt alive? When have I felt like the real me?” No internal judgments or people-pleasing. No second-guessing or self-criticism. Just feelings of engagement and enjoyment. Whenever you feel authentic and genuine, you are headed in the right direction.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 225, loc. 2710-13\n\nWhen you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different. By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it easier to stand out. You can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for years of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 225, loc. 2721-25\n\nAnd yet Steve Martin faced this fear every week for eighteen years. In his words, “10 years spent learning, 4 years spent refining, and 4 years as a wild success.”  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 230, loc. 2771-73\n\none of the most consistent findings is that the way to maintain motivation and achieve peak levels of desire is to work on tasks of “just manageable difficulty.”  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 231, loc. 2775-77\n\nBut this coach was saying that really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 234, loc. 2812-13\n\nAs Machiavelli noted, “Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly.”  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 234, loc. 2820-21\n\nVariable rewards or not, no habit will stay interesting forever. At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom. We all have goals that we would like to achieve and dreams that we would like to fulfill, but it doesn’t matter what you are trying to become better at, if you only do the work when it’s convenient or exciting, then you’ll never be consistent enough to achieve remarkable results.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 235, loc. 2835-39\n\nProfessionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way. Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose; amateurs get pulled off course by the urgencies of life.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 236, loc. 2842-44\n\nThe Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored. Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference. Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 237, loc. 2852-56\n\nWhen you know the simple movements so well that you can perform them without thinking, you are free to pay attention to more advanced details.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 239, loc. 2863-64\n\nHabits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 240, loc. 2876\n\n“Sustaining an effort is the most important thing for any enterprise. The way to be successful is to learn how to do things right, then do them the same way every time.”  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 244, loc. 2925-26\n\nWhat went well this year? What didn’t go so well this year? What did I learn?  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 246, loc. 2947-48\n\nMy yearly Integrity Report answers three questions: What are the core values that drive my life and work? How am I living and working with integrity right now? How can I set a higher standard in the future?  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 246, loc. 2952-55\n\n“keep your identity small.” The more you let a single belief define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 248, loc. 2975-76\n\nSuccess is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 252, loc. 3022-23\n\nYou want to push your good habits toward the left side of the spectrum by making them obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. Meanwhile, you want to cluster your bad habits toward the right side by making them invisible, unattractive, hard, and unsatisfying.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 253, loc. 3036-38\n\nHappiness is not about the achievement of pleasure (which is joy or satisfaction), but about the lack of desire. It arrives when you have no urge to feel differently. Happiness is the state you enter when you no longer want to change your state.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 260, loc. 3070-71\n\nPeace occurs when you don’t turn your observations into problems. The first step in any behavior is observation. You notice a cue, a bit of information, an event. If you do not desire to act on what you observe, then you are at peace.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 260, loc. 3077-78\n\nGreat craving can power great action—even when friction is high.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 261, loc. 3084-85\n\nBeing curious is better than being smart. Being motivated and curious counts for more than being smart because it leads to action. Being smart will never deliver results on its own because it doesn’t get you to act. It is desire, not intelligence, that prompts behavior. As Naval Ravikant says, “The trick to doing anything is first cultivating a desire for it.”  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 261, loc. 3085-87\n\nEmotions drive behavior. Every decision is an emotional decision at some level. Whatever your logical reasons are for taking action, you only feel compelled to act on them because of emotion.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 261, loc. 3087-89\n\nSuffering drives progress. The source of all suffering is the desire for a change in state. This is also the source of all progress. The desire to change your state is what powers you to take action. It is wanting more that pushes humanity to seek improvements, develop new technologies, and reach for a higher level. With craving, we are dissatisfied but driven. Without craving, we are satisfied but lack ambition.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 262, loc. 3102-5\n\nIf you keep saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don’t really want it. It’s time to have an honest conversation with yourself. Your actions reveal your true motivations.  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 262, loc. 3105-7\n\nSeneca’s famous quote, “Being poor is not having too little, it is wanting more.”  -- James Clear, Atomic Habits, pg. 263, loc. 3118-19\n\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/a8186426-866e-4b6f-bab8-1393b85b7f9a.html","relUrl":"notes/a8186426-866e-4b6f-bab8-1393b85b7f9a.html"},{"doc":"Artificial Intelligence Framework   a Visual Introduction to Machine Learning and Ai","title":"Artificial Intelligence Framework   a Visual Introduction to Machine Learning and Ai","hpath":"artificial-intelligence-framework---a-visual-introduction-to-machine-learning-and-ai","content":"- `Title:` [[Artificial Intelligence Framework - A Visual Introduction to Machine Learning and AI]]\n- `Type:` \n- `Tags:` \n- `Author:` \n  - `Notable Authors:` \n- `Reference:` \n- `Publish Date:` \n- `Reviewed Date:` [[2021-02-19]]\n- link <https://towardsdatascience.com/artificial-intelligence-framework-a-visual-introduction-to-machine-learning-and-ai-d7e36b304f87>\n\n* * *\n\n\"Artificial Intelligence is very useful in order to digitize cognitive capabilities where the exact rules to follow are difficult to explain.\"\n\nUse AI when it's too hard to describe your own problem solving process\n\n[[Moore's Law]]\n\nDrivers of AI\n\tComputing power - increasing with Moore's Lw\n\tAvailability of Data - \"In the last two years alone, an impressive 90% of the world’s data was generated ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/05/21/how-much-data-do-we-create-every-day-the-mind-blowing-stats-everyone-should-read/#5a3000b460ba)).\"\n\tAI Research - very popular and lots of progress right now - improvement of algorithms\n\nMost researcher's agree the superintelligence will be reached at some point. \n\nSupervised learning can have classification and regression.

It's about making dreams come true for others and for yourself. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 32-33\n\n“Ah, screw it. I'l just set up my own online store. How hard could it be?” -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 53-54\n\nIf you think your life's purpose needs to hit you like a lightning bolt, you'l overlook the little day-to-day things that fascinate you. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 94-95\n\nSuccess comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently doing what's not working. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 105-6\n\nNo plan survives first contact with customers. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 127-28\n\nNecessity is a great teacher. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 140\n\nIf you're ever unsure what to prioritize, just ask your customers the open-ended question, “How can I best help you now?” Then focus on satisfying those requests. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 145-46\n\nYou need to confidently exclude people, and proudly say what you're not. By doing so, you wil win the hearts of the people you want. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 211-12\n\nI started this as a hobby to help my friends, and that's the only reason it exists. There's money in the bank and I'm doing fine, so no worries.” -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 273-74\n\nAre you helping people? Are they happy? Are you happy? Are you profitable? Isn't that enough? -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 276-77\n\nHe was shocked. He had never heard a business owner say he didn't care about the survival of his company. To me, it was just common sense. Of course you should care about your customers more than you care about yourself! Isn't that Rule #1 of providing a good service? It's al about them, not about you. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 292-94\n\nIf you set up your business like you don't need the money, people are happier to pay you. When someone's doing something for the money, people can sense it, like a desperate lover. It's a turnoff. When someone's doing something for love, being generous instead of stingy, trusting instead of fearful, it triggers this law: We want to give to those who give. It's another Tao of business: Set up your business like you don't need the money, and it'l likely come your way. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 303-7\n\nWhen we yel at our car or our coffee machine, it's fine because they're just mechanical appliances. So when we yel at a website or a company, using our computer or our phone, we forget that it's not an appliance but a person that's affected. It's dehumanizing to have thousands of people passing through our computer screens, so we do things we'd never do if those people were sitting next to us. It's too overwhelming to remember that at the end of every computer is a real person, a lot like you, whose birthday was last week, who has three best friends but nobody to spoon at night, and who is personal y affected by what you say. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 343-48\n\nWriting that email to customers—carefully eliminating every unnecessary word, and reshaping every sentence to make sure it could not be misunderstood—would take me all day. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 354-55\n\nWhen you're thinking of how to make your business bigger, it's tempting to try to think all the big thoughts and come up with world-changing massive-action plans. But please know that it's often the tiny details that really thrill people enough to make them tell all their friends about you. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 374-76\n\nIf you find even the smallest way to make people smile, they'l remember you more for that smile than for all your other fancy business-model stuff. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 377-78\n\nWith one line of code, I made it so that every outgoing email customized the “From:” field to be “CD Baby loves {firstname}.” -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 388-89\n\nI wanted to say yes but let him know that this was real y hard to do, so I made a policy that made us both smile: “We'l do anything for a pizza.” If you needed a big special favor, we'd give you the number of our local pizza delivery place. If you bought us a pizza, we'd do any favor you wanted. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 392-94\n\nEven if you want to be big someday, remember that you never need to act like a big boring company. Over ten years, it seemed like every time someone raved about how much he loved CD Baby, it was because of one of these little fun human touches. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 404-6\n\nThere's a benefit to being naïve about the norms of the world— deciding from scratch what seems like the right thing to do, instead of just doing what others do. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 431-33\n\nIt's about being, not having -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 444\n\nThey'l assume the only reason we do anything is to get it done, and doing it yourself is not the most efficient way. But that's forgetting about the joy of learning and doing. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 472-74\n\nYou might get bigger faster and make mil ions if you outsourced everything to the experts. But what's the point of getting bigger and making mil ions? To be happy, right? In the end, it's about what you want to be, not what you want to have. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 476-78\n\nBut I never again promised a customer that I could do something that was beyond my ful control. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 535-36\n\nI asked one person to start a manual, write down the answer to this one situation, and write down the philosophy behind it. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 582-83\n\n1. Gather everybody around. 2. Answer the question and explain the philosophy. 3. Make sure everyone understands the thought process. 4. Ask one person to write it in the manual. 5. Let everybody know they can decide this without me next time. After two months of this, there were no more questions. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 584-88\n\nTo be a true business owner, make sure you could leave for a year, and when you came back, your business would be doing better than when you left. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 600-601\n\nTrust, but verify. Remember it when delegating. You have to do both. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 641-42\n\nI learned an important word: abdicate. To abdicate means to surrender or relinquish power or responsibility; this word is usual y used when a king abdicates the throne or crown. Lesson learned too late: Delegate, but don't abdicate. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 661-63\n\nJoseph said, “Yes, but I have something he'l never have.... Enough.” When I decided to sel CD Baby, I already had enough. I live simply. I don't own a house, a car, or even a TV. The less I own, the happier I am. The lack of stuff gives me the priceless freedom to live anywhere anytime. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 691-93\n\nThen, when Disc Makers bought CD Baby, they bought it not from me but from the trust, turning it into $22 mil ion cash to benefit music education. It's not that I'm altruistic. I'm sacrificing nothing. I've just learned what makes me happy. And doing it this way made me the happiest. I get the deeper happiness of knowing that the lucky streak I've had in my life will benefit tons of people—not just me. I get the pride of knowing I did something irreversibly smart before I could change my mind. I get the safety of knowing I won't be the target of wrongful lawsuits, since I have very little net worth. I get the unburdened freedom of having it out of my hands so I can't do something stupid. But most of all , I get the constant priceless reminder that I have enough. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 699-705\n\nJust pay close attention to what excites you and what drains you. Pay close attention to when you're being the real you and when you're trying to impress an invisible jury. Even if what you're doing is slowing the growth of your business—if it makes you happy, that's OK. It's your choice to remain small. You'l notice that as my company got bigger, my stories about it were less happy. That was my lesson learned. I'm happier with five employees than with eighty-five, and happiest working alone. -- Derek Sivers, Anything You Want, loc. 712-16\n\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/459ea358-0495-4688-bd25-26c4bf21b768.html","relUrl":"notes/459ea358-0495-4688-bd25-26c4bf21b768.html"},{"doc":"Ai Index 2019 Report Highlights","title":"Ai Index 2019 Report Highlights","hpath":"ai-index-2019-report-highlights","content":"- `Title:` [[AI Index 2019 Report Highlights]]\n- `Type:` \n- `Tags:` \n- `Author:` \n  - `Notable Authors:` \n- `Reference:` \n- `Publish Date:` \n- `Reviewed Date:` [[2021-02-19]]\n- link = <https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/ai_index_2019_report.pdf>\n\n* * *\n\n1. Research and Development\n\n• Between 1998 and 2018, the volume of peer-reviewed AI papers has grown by more than 300%, accounting for 3% of peer-reviewed journal publications and 9% of published conference papers.\n\nMany Western European countries, especially the Netherlands and Denmark, as well as Argentina, Canada, and Iran show relatively high presence of women in AI research.\n\n• In a year and a half, the time required to train a large image classification system on cloud infrastructure has fallen from about three hours in October 2017 to about 88 seconds in July, 2019. During the same period, the cost to train such a system has fallen similarly\n\nPrior to 2012, AI results closely tracked Moore’s Law, with compute doubling every two years. Post-2012, compute has been doubling every 3.4 months. 4. Economy\n\n4. Economy\n\nGlobally, investment in AI startups continues its steady ascent. From a total of $1.3B raised in 2010 to over $40.4B in 2018 (with $37.4B in 2019 as of November 4th), funding has increased at an average annual growth rate of over 48%.\n\nAutonomous Vehicles (AVs) received the largest share of global investment over the last year with $7.7B (9.9% of the total), followed by Drug, Cancer and Therapy ($4.7B, 6.1%), Facial Recognition ($4.7B, 6.0%), Video Content ($3.6B, 4.5%), and Fraud Detection and Finance ($3.1B, 3.9%).\n\nThe total number of miles driven and total number of companies testing autonomous vehicles (AVs) in California has grown over seven-fold between 2015-2018. In 2018, the State of California licensed testing for over 50 companies and more than 500 AVs, which drove over 2 million miles\n\n• In over 3600 global news articles on ethics and AI identified between mid-2018 and mid-2019, the dominant topics are framework and guidelines on the ethical use of AI, data privacy, the use of face recognition, algorithm bias and the role of big tech. \n\n• AI can contribute to each of the 17 United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through use cases identified to-date that address about half of the 169 UN SDG targets, but bottlenecks still need to be overcome to deploy AI for sustainable development at scale.\n\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/4f528cc6-501d-499f-baed-858d2c173184.html","relUrl":"notes/4f528cc6-501d-499f-baed-858d2c173184.html"},{"doc":"Aaron Gertler","title":"Aaron Gertler","hpath":"aaron-gertler","content":"## key ideas\n\n[[Most of your returns (in everything) come from Compound Interest]]\n\nConcrete and specific knowledge is useful to others [[how to write to help others]]\n\nGet a sense of where the people are at before telling them how they should change\n\nIs there a skill I can gain along the way\n\n* * *\n\nnonfiction writing\nread out loud\nprinting out\n\nConcrete over abstract\n\nSpecific pieces of narrow info are most likely what you have to offer.

From 2006 to 2018, GDP per capita doubled in size, while the average life satisfaction of the population dropped from 5.35 to 3.82 on a 0 to 10-point scale, a staggering 25% decrease.\"\n\teconomy and well-being can be severely uncorrelated\n\n\"raising general welfare requires a broader understanding of progress than the one given by standard economic and financial indicators.\"\n\n\"7 In 2019, the Business Roundtable, representing chief executive officers from many of the most powerful American companies including Apple and Amazon, redefined the purpose of the company away from delivering value to shareholders in favour of delivering value to consumers, employees, and communities\"\n\tCrazy that even the biggest corporations are headed in this direction\n\tBut they don't yet have a good understanding of how to do this -> WALY\n\n\"Many nations around the world are already reeling from the destabilising effects of a diminishing sense of meaning in people’s lives, a trend that is likely to be exacerbated by rising automation and climate change\" -> [[existential vacuum and Nothingbutness]] \n\tBefore we could believe our meaning was important, now we know it's not\n\nStated preferences aren't good enough because we don't know our exact preferences or experiences.\n\n\" Neither QALYs nor DALYs factor in how patients of various diseases actually experience their lives. Instead, they are rooted in public perceptions they may or may not hold true to reality. By rooting health evaluations in patient self-reports, WALYs can therefore offer a much needed new approach to evaluating health outcomes in terms of patient experience.\"\n\tSimilar to how having a disability is less bad than one would imagine it to be.\n\t\"When calculating QALYs and DALYs, because utility weights for health states are derived from public preferences, mental health can often be undervalued. When promoted to imagine what life must be like with any number of health conditions, most people tend to assume that physical disabilities have more negative effects on quality of life than they actually do.13 For most people, it is simply much harder to imagine the effects of mental illness or social isolation.\"\n\n\"One recent analysis of 15,184 hospital patients in Wales found that anxiety and depression had degrading effects on self-assessed quality of life that were ten times as severe as extreme pain.15 Struggling to walk, even being bedridden, had no effect at all. This result was later replicated in a similar analysis of American adults.16 Another widely cited meta-analysis found that loneliness and social isolation posed mortality risks equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes per day.\"\n\tPhysical health has little impact on mental health, while obviously mental health issues have huge impacts.\n\n\"Currently, the impact of symptoms on quality of life are most often assessed using three patient questionnaires: the EQ-5D, the SF-36, and the HUI. However, while these instruments cover numerous aspects of physical wellbeing, they fall relatively silent on mental and social wellbeing.\"\t\n\tWe tend not to seriously try to measure social and mental wellbeing when considering health interventions. But what is the point of being healthy if not to live a good happy life?\n\n\"Of the top 20 symptoms we identified, ten relate to mental wellbeing, three relate to social wellbeing, and seven relate to physical wellbeing. These leading symptoms can be grouped into six overarching categories: selfsufficiency, depression/anxiety, vitality, optimism, engagement, and loneliness.\"\n\tDeterminants of a good life\n\nDoesn't seem bad to lose a limb, or sight and be happy, but what about being rich and famous and depressed? Seems like the mental aspect is most fundamental and important\n\n\"As this analysis makes clear, the costs of urban air pollution can be substantial. In the most polluted European cities, WALYs lost due to pollution even approach average WALYs lost due to Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s disease.\"\n\n\\#seed\n\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/b52443df-82cf-4b65-8312-893df74e4ad4.html","relUrl":"notes/b52443df-82cf-4b65-8312-893df74e4ad4.html"},{"doc":"2021 03 06","title":"2021 03 06","hpath":"2021-03-06","content":"<https://iep.utm.edu/sen-cap/#H2>\n\njust because people adapt to their circumstances doesn't mean those circumstances are actually as good as other ones.

There is objective morality, there is not objective meaning.\n\nThe feeling of meaning basically always consists of committing yourself to some purpose so that the sum of your actions means something more than just each part of it. For example running a marathon, a movie, overcoming any struggle fundamentally\n```\n\n# Meaning is a Feeling\n\n### My thoughts on meaning\n\nHeavily inspired and informed by Man's Search for Meaning\n\n```\nSummary: Meaning, Purpose, and Morality are different yet interrelated. We need a purpose, which is often based in morality (and reality) to reach a subjective feeling of meaning. This feeling of meaning can deeply affect our well-being because it can override the pleasure or suffering of a string of moments through the stories we tell ourselves about those experiences.\n```\n\n## Why are we losing meaning?\n\nOur understanding of ourselves as nothing but animals made of dead stuff makes it clear that there is no inherent meaning in the world aside from that which comes subjectively -- from human values. The universe will one day be completely dead and cold and all of our achievements and failures will be dust.\n\nScience and technology are leading us towards a more machine-like -- although accurate -- view of the world that makes it easy to see things as a nihilist. We are losing the traditions, religions, and obvious mystery in our world that used to tell us or at least let us wonder what we should do, but now we must decide for ourselves. The freedom is paralyzing.\n\nIn the past, purpose was more simple and clear. Religion, family, survival. For the modern American, \"No instinct tells him what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do.\"\n\nAny purpose we might have is just a story we are telling ourselves. But some subjective purpose sounds a lot better than just doing nothing.\n\n![](external-content.duckduckgo.jpg)\n\n(This is not to say that all morality and purpose are completely relative and can't be compared, only that individual purpose and individual meaning are subjective.)\n\nThe conclusion that nothing matters come from the searching for absolute meaning, but we can find meaning in the meaningless: striving to be an Olympic weightlifter, hiking to the top of a mountain, running a marathon or helping others. These goals are all human and arbitrary but still give people a deep sense of meaning.\n\n## What is meaning?\n\nI have gotten confused before thinking that meaning is something more than a feeling. From reading too much moral philosophy my mistake was equating the feeling of meaning that is central to our well-being with moral importance or living an ethical life. \n\nMost people tend to derive some meaning in their life from their ethics, but meaning can also be decoupled from morals. \n\nTo me morality means improving human well-being, but even if my charitable donations are the thing that most improve other people's lives, those donations don't feel meaningful to me. I see charitable donations as highly morally important, because I can help people through them, but it's nearly impossible for that impersonal donation to feel meaningful. It doesn't activate my evolutionary instincts for what is supposed to feel meaningful. \n\nMeaning is only a feeling that at different times may or may not be related to ethics. \n\nI think confusion comes in here from using meaning like it's used in \"what is the meaning of life\". Here, meaning really means purpose. \n\nNeither your life or all life could have an objective purpose. If you told me that the reason I was alive, or the reason everyone was alive was because a cosmic turtle vomited and our universe came out, I would ask why the cosmic turtle exists. And if you told me the purpose of my life was to help others, or be the best person I could be, or to make paper clips, I would also ask why. Both chains are endless, or just stop at the last thing we can't explain -- like the big bang.\n\nTherefore if there was an objective purpose to my life or all life, it seems it would have to be outside of my ability to understand it, and then it is essentially useless for me to try to ground my actions in this purpose. \n\nPurpose, meaning and morality are different but interrelated. It seems impossible that there is an objective purpose to life but we generally must find some subjective purpose to have experiences and live a life that feels meaningful. One way people often find this purpose is through their personal morality. \n\n## Where is meaning?\n\nWhen an experience is meaningful, its individual parts aim towards a collective purpose that gives context to each part. On reflection, the experience was more -- or at least, different -- than just the collection of moments that made it up. Consider how the full meaningfulness of each scene in a movie can't be fully understood or appreciated until the end of it, and how little any individual scene would have meant on its own. \n\nMeaning seems to be related to whether we like ourselves as the protagonist in our narrative memories. Will I be able to tell myself a good story tonight about how I performed and struggled and overcame obstacles today, or only how I suffered pointlessly?\n\nThe most common way we find meaning is through our goals and struggles. We set goals or are given challenges that make our temporary purpose overcoming that obstacle. Each experience on this path of overcoming now has a deeper purpose -- however subjective it is -- that can make this experience feel meaningful.\n\nThe goal isn't fundamental to this feeling of meaning, but the purpose is. A general purpose of \"making the world a better place\" or \"doing good\" is not a goal that can be achieved, but people can still find meaning in it because it can give a deeper context for their actions and decisions.\n\nIn general, we feel meaning from hiking up mountains and not hiking in circles. \n\n#### Meaning's importance to well-being\n\nMeaning is a foundational aspect of human well-being. The sense of meaning underlying any experience can keep pain from turning into suffering, or keep pleasure from leading to happiness. \n\nIn _Man's Search For Meaning_, Viktor Frankl writes that the three places people most often find our well-being is through their work, through their relationships, and by being courageous through hardship. \n\nSurprisingly, even people in the worst situations, such as concentration camps, can find hope and meaning in their daily lives by looking toward the future and taking responsibility for whatever they retain control over. Even in these awful conditions, one can persevere by thinking to the future \"of the responsibility he bears toward a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, [and] will never be able to throw away his life.\"\n\nThis allows him to put his current suffering in the context of a greater purpose. Suffering can be bearable as long as there is a reason behind it. (On a smaller scale, consider enjoyable pain in the context of working out).\n\nWe have even more examples of the converse: People who are super rich or famous yet miserable. Clearly human well-being comes down to more than a string of positive or pleasurable moments. \n\nThe feeling of meaning that is available when people have an underlying purpose is more important to human well-being than the actual pain and pleasure of successive moments themselves. \n\n","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/20263fd4-f7a1-41ad-b8f9-6181a51a2d07.html","relUrl":"notes/20263fd4-f7a1-41ad-b8f9-6181a51a2d07.html"},{"doc":"Changelog","title":"Changelog","hpath":"root.changelog","content":"","url":"notes.harrytaussig.com/notes/changelog.html","relUrl":"notes/changelog.html"}]
